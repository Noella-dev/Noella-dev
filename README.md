<br />

🧭 I see technology as a vast, ever-shifting landscape — full of uncharted zones, hidden gems, and unsolved mysteries.<br />
🌐 The world of the web holds no secrets for me — I master it from front to back.<br />
💡 I’m not here to follow the map — I’m here to draw new ones.<br />
🤖 Currently exploring the wild terrains of Machine Learning and intelligent systems. <br />
🛠️ I build projects like expeditions: with curiosity as fuel, and bugs as obstacles to overcome.<br />
🌱 I believe every line of code is a step forward — even when the path isn’t clear.<br />
